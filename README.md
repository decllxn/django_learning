## My Django learning
# Intro
- Django is a python web framework
- Uses a concept known as object-relational mapping which makes working with databases easier

# Virtual Environment 
- Using venv(virtual environment)
- It is suggested to have a virtual environment when working with Django
- Installing python3.10-venv
- To start, first create a directory for the virtual environment
  python3 -m venv 'name_of_directory'
- Then activate with
  source name_of_directory/bin/activate
